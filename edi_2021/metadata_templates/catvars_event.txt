FieldComments	Debris trapped around cone.	
FieldComments	decent amount of small MSS & shad <25mm	
FieldComments	Deep at the end, so had trouble keeping lead line down when pulling up seine.	
FieldComments	Deep water, slow moving seine. Seine width was <4m at times during sampling due to the water being too deep.	
FieldComments	DFG drained large pond upstream 5/21/08	
FieldComments	Did a second sweep with old seine and only had 2 SHR

FieldComments	Due to high FAV (Hyacinth) we moved the start and stop points down by ~1meter	
FieldComments	Due to high flow, trap was not fishing in middle of channel.	
FieldComments	Due to high flows, trap did not get pushed all the way in to te center of the channel- code 2	
FieldComments	due to hyacynth length shortened	
FieldComments	Due to overgrown primrose had to make shorter seine	
FieldComments	Due to primrose overgrowth, length of seine shortened by 8m	
FieldComments	due to primrose, had to do short haul
